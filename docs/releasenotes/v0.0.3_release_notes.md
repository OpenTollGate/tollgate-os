### Release Notes for v0.0.3

#### General Release Notes (Non-Technical Users)

The v0.0.3 release of TollGateOS introduces several significant improvements and new features from [tollgate-basic-module-go v0.0.3](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/tollgate-module-basic-go/releases/tag/v0.0.3):

1. **Automatic Lightning Payouts**: The router now automatically pays out accumulated funds to Lightning addresses, making it easier to receive your earnings without manual intervention.
2. **Profit Sharing**: Added support for splitting payments between multiple Lightning addresses, allowing for flexible revenue distribution among partners or service providers.
3. **Improved Configuration**: Enhanced configuration options for mints with more detailed settings for balance management and payout preferences.

These changes make the TollGate Module more autonomous, allowing you to receive your earnings automatically and share profits with partners or service providers with minimal manual intervention.

#### Technical Release Notes (Technical Contributors)

For developers and technical contributors, the v0.0.3 release includes:

1. **Lightning Integration**: New `lightning` package implementing the lightning payouts

2. **TollWallet Enhancements**:
   - `MeltToLightning` functionality for converting Cashu tokens to Lightning payments
   - Adaptive payment amounts with automatic fee handling
   - Fallback strategies for handling failed payments

3. **Merchant Service**:
   - Introduced merchant module, responsible for all financial decisions made by the TollGate
   - New automatic payout routine that periodically checks balances
   - Configurable minimum balances and payout thresholds
   - Implementation of profit sharing between multiple lightning addresses based on configured factors

4. **Configuration Manager Updates**:
   - New `MintConfig` structure with detailed per-mint settings including:
     - Minimum balance requirements
     - Balance tolerance percentages (tolerance = variance in minimal balence to account for unpredictable lightning fees during payouts)
     - Payout intervals and minimum payout amounts
   - New `ProfitShareConfig` structure supporting:
     - Multiple Lightning addresses for payouts
     - Configurable distribution factors for each recipient
   - Default configuration with 70%/30% profit sharing example. Should be updated by owner on first boot.

5. **Code Organization**:
   - Modular architecture with separation of concerns between wallet, merchant, and lightning components
   - Improved error handling and logging across components
   - Better test coverage for new features

These technical changes provide an automated, flexible payment distribution system built on top of the existing TollGate functionality, enhancing the module's value proposition for operators and making it more self-managing.

#### Installation Instructions

To install the v0.0.3 release of TollGate Module Basic Go, you have two options:

##### Option 1: Automatic Update via JANITOR (For Existing v0.0.2 Installations)

If you are already running v0.0.2 of TollGate Module Basic Go, the JANITOR service will automatically handle the update process:

1. The JANITOR service periodically checks for new versions of installed packages
2. When v0.0.3 is detected, it will automatically download and install the update
3. After installation, you'll need to configure your profit sharing settings as described in the Configuration Example section below

##### Option 2: Fresh Installation via TollGate Installer

For new installations or manual updates, use the TollGate Installer to get the latest TollGateOS:

1. Visit the [TollGate Installer](https://github.com/OpenTollGate/installer) repository
2. Follow the installation instructions for your specific router hardware
3. The installer will configure the entire TollGateOS system, which includes the TollGate Module Basic Go v0.0.3
4. After installation, you'll need to configure your profit sharing settings as described in the Configuration Example section below

#### Configuration Example

After installation, you should configure your profit sharing settings in the configuration file. Here's an example configuration:

Config location: `/etc/tollgate/config.json`

```json
"profit_share": [
  {
    "factor": 0.70,
    "lightning_address": "your@lightningprovider.com"
  },
  {
    "factor": 0.30,
    "lightning_address": "tollgate@minibits.cash"
  }
]
```

This configuration will automatically split profits with 70% going to the primary Lightning address and 30% to the tollgate address.
