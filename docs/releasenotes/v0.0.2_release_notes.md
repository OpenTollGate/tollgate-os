### Revised Release Notes for v0.0.2

#### General Release Notes (Non-Technical Users)

The v0.0.2 release of TollGate OS introduces several significant improvements and new features:

1. **Enhanced Build and Deployment**: We've streamlined our build process with new GitHub Actions workflows, making it easier to create and publish releases. The build workflow now automatically determines the OS version and release channel.
2. **Improved Configuration Management**: The configuration management system has been enhanced, allowing for more flexible and robust setup options.
3. **Randomized LAN IP**: The system now randomizes the LAN IP address on first boot, improving security and reducing potential IP conflicts.
4. **Updated First Boot Configuration**: The first boot script has been updated to configure the network settings more effectively, including setting DNS servers to CloudFlare DNS.
5. **New Release Management**: We've introduced a new release.json file to manage module versions and dependencies.
6. **Package Management**: We've added package management files (packages_dev.json and packages_stable.json) to define external and custom packages for the OS.

These changes collectively enhance the functionality, reliability, and maintainability of TollGate OS.

#### Technical Release Notes (Technical Contributors)

For developers and technical contributors, the v0.0.2 release includes:

1. **Build System Overhaul**: The introduction of a new build workflow in `.github/workflows/build-firmware.yml` automates the package creation process across multiple architectures and OpenWRT versions. It now determines the OS version and release channel based on the GitHub ref.
2. **Random LAN IP Script**: A new script (`95-random-lan-ip.sh`) has been added to randomize the LAN IP address on first boot, improving security.
3. **Release JSON**: A new `release.json` file has been introduced in `files/etc/tollgate/` to manage module versions and dependencies.
4. **First Boot Script Updates**: The first boot script (`91-os-firstboot-script.sh`) has been updated to configure network settings, including setting DNS servers to CloudFlare DNS and setting the domain to 'lan'.
5. **Package Management Files**: New files (`packages_dev.json` and `packages_stable.json`) have been added to define external and custom packages for the OS.

These technical changes provide a more robust, maintainable, and scalable foundation for TollGate OS, while also introducing new features and improving existing functionality.
